Use the Admin UI
History 
In GitLab 17.3 and later, you can use the Admin UI to disable personal access tokens:

On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select Admin.
Select Settings > General.
Expand Visibility and access controls.
Select the Disable personal access tokens checkbox.
Select Save changes.

Change the diff colors
Diffs use two different background colors to show changes between versions of code. By default, the original file is in red, and the changes are in green.
